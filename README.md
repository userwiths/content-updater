This program is inspired by my pains of using github software and having to update
them two, and because I am a chaotic person the git repositories are all around the filesystem
this simple program updates [system], [git], [all]->both, it searches the filesystem starting from
HOME if there is no other argument after [git] and updates all the met repositories.

It also detects the used [Unix] Package manager and updates the system.
